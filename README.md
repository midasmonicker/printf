This is the repository for our first collaborative project in the ALX Software Engineering programme.

In this project, we were asked to work in pairs nd ensure that each member of the team contributes (almost) equally to the task. Each member's contribution will be evidenced in the number of commits.

ALX has provided some rules that must be followed during the project, and those are the guidelines that will be followed to ensure we meet the programme expectations.
